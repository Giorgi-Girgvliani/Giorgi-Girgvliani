        We'll never get free, lamb to the slaughter
        What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?
        The price of your greed is your son and your daughter
        What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?
        Look me in my eyes
        
        Tell me everything's not fine
        Or that people ain't happy
        And the river has run dry
        You thought you could go free

        But the system is done for
        If you listen here closely
        There's a knock at your front door
        We'll never get free, lamb to the slaughter

        What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?
        The price of your greed is your son and your daughter
        What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?
        When there's blood in the-

        Wh-, wh-, when there's blood in the-
        Beg me for mercy
        Admit you were toxic
        You poisoned me just for

        Another dollar in your pocket
        Now I am the violence
        I am the sickness
        Won't accept your silence

        Beg me for forgiveness
        We'll never get free, lamb to the slaughter
        What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?
        The price of your greed, your son and your daughter

        What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?
        When there's blood in the water
        Wh-, wh-, when there's blood in the-
        I am the people, I am the storm

        I am the riot, I am the swarm
        When the last tree's fallen, the animal can't hide
        Money won't solve it, what's your alibi?
        What's your alibi? What's your alibi?

        What you gon' do when there's blood in the, blood in the water?
        When there's blood in the water
        Wh-, wh-, when there's blood in the-
        Wh-, wh-, when there's blood in the water
